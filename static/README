              Version 0.3 of the ecv class

              -----------------------------

This LaTeX provides a simple environment for laying out a
fancy curriculum vitae with LaTeX. The class is intended
to be self-contained so it should not be necessary to fiddle
around with thousand other packages to get a nicely 
formatted CV.

As this class is created mainly for ourselves it does not
contain evil low-level TeX magic but instead uses many other
fancy LaTeX packages that we hope you have already installed.
