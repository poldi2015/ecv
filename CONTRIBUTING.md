Thank you for your interest in helping us to make ECV better!

# Goal of This Document
This document aims at answering all the questions potential contributors to ECV might have before feeling ready to get started.

# What This Document is not
If you are looking for general information about what ECV is, please make sure to check out the [README.md](./README.md) that comes with the project.

# What Kind of Contributions can be made?

## Contributing Code
If you are a programmer and want to help us improve, fix or extend the implementationof ECV please create a branch or fork of the current `master` branch using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and make your changes on that branch.

Then please create a pull request and ask for a review by one of the core team members (e.g. `poldi2015`).
The reviewers will either ask you to work in review findings or if there are none, merge your branch.

## Try out and testing
We are happy if you experiment with ECV! While we do a great deal of testing ourselves, we want ECV to be as portable as possible. So it is especially helpful for us if you test on a platform that we don't have.

If you find a bug, please let us know by writing an [issue ticket](https://github.com/poldi2015/ecv/issues/new).

## Contributing to the user guide
